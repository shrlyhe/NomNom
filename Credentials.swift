// IMPORTANT NOTE: you should replace the clarifaiClientID and clarifaiClientSecret values below
// with your own. You can obtain these at https://developer.clarifai.com/applications -- the
// defaults are shared credentials that will stop working once their quota is reached.
//
// Also, if you're committing your code to a public repo, be careful not to check in your
// credentials -- we're including these here so you can get started out of the box, but this is
// generally a bad practice.
